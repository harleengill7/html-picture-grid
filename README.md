# html-picture-grid
For this assignment, we were to upload 5 things: a picture of ourselves, first and last name, and our favourite book and song, to the UM-Dearborn public server. This way, we can learn more about our classmates. With this information, we were asked to create a web-page using HTML that would showcase all the students information in a grid format.
